DEN Economic Lab is committed to providing a welcoming and respectful environment
for everyone who engages with our work — whether as a lab member, external
researcher, student, policymaker, or member of the public.

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
